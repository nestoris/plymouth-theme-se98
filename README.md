# SE98 1920x1080 Plymouth theme

## Disclaimer

I just edited the [Windoze95 1080 Plymouth theme](https://github.com/Liftu/Windoze95-1080-Plymouth-theme) of [Liftu](https://github.com/Liftu) who just edited a work of [LASZCZ](https://www.pling.com/u/Laszcz) -- [Windoze95](https://www.pling.com/p/1202357/).

Edits from Liftu version :
- Change background image.
- Extra slowed down the progress bar cycle.

## Installation

Just run `./install.sh` to install it.
You can run `./test-plymouth` to display the current bootsplash theme.
