# SE98 1080 Plymouth theme

## Disclaimer

I just edited the [Windoze95 1080 Plymouth theme](https://github.com/Liftu/Windoze95-1080-Plymouth-theme) of @Liftu who just edited a work of LASZCZ (https://www.pling.com/p/1202357/)

Edits from original :
- Change background image.
- Extra slowed down the progress bar cycle.

## Installation

Just run `./install` to install it.
You can run `./test-plymouth` to display the current bootsplash theme.
